## 🧩 Projects Overview

### 🔑 1. Keylogger
A Python-based keylogger that captures all keystrokes pressed on a keyboard and logs them into a file. It demonstrates how keylogging works internally and serves as a cautionary example of how input can be tracked if proper security is not maintained.  
**Use responsibly and only on authorized systems.**

### 🔐 2. Caesar Cipher
Implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project showcases the basics of symmetric encryption and can both encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift key.

### 🎨 3. Pixel Operations (pixel.py)
A simple image-processing script that reads images and accesses/modifies individual pixel values. Useful for understanding how digital images work at the RGB level and how they can be used for tasks like steganography, watermarking, or forensic image analysis.
